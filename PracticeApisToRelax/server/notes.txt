redirect to another page/route on our application - call whatever you want 
(/auth/provider) - facebook or google 

we handle the route on our application  /auth/google in our case
- user wants to sign in with google 
callback function to google (we're going over there now ) - gather info about user 
then look up in our own database. 

THEN we create the cookie - send to browser - we can use this cookie to communicate between back/front 

Using passport for four parts:
1 - auth/google handler 
2 - receiving user details from provider 
3 - creating cookie 
4 - decoding cookie
